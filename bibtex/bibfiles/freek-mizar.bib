abstract="A small project in which I encoded a proof of Arrow's theorem---probably the most famous results in the economics field of social choice theory---in the computer using the Mizar system is presented here. The details of this specific project, as well as the process of formalization (encoding proofs in the computer) in general are discussed.",
